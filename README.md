SMTP Training Gateway

This project implements a conceptual SMTP email gateway for security awareness training.
Incoming emails are received, analysed using rule-based logic derived from phishing
persuasion literature, augmented with educational banners, and forwarded to a downstream
mail server.

This is a prototype design intended for academic evaluation, not a production mail system.
