This directory contains paraphrased phishing-style and benign email examples used for rule justification in an educational SMTP gateway prototype.

Examples are derived from publicly available phishing reports (e.g. MillerSmiles) and are paraphrased to remove branding, links, and identifiers.

These samples are not used for model training and are intended solely for explainable rule weighting and security awareness research.
