Subject: Tax refund available for a limited period

Dear Customer,

We are contacting you to inform you that you are eligible for a tax refund resulting from an overpayment in a previous tax year.

The refund amount is available to be claimed for a limited period before it is carried forward or becomes unavailable.

To receive your refund, you are required to submit a claim by confirming your details through the appropriate process.

If no action is taken, the refund may be delayed or rolled into future tax records.
