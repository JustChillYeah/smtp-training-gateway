Subject: Bequest notification – beneficiary selected

Attention,

You have been identified as a selected beneficiary in relation to a personal bequest.

A substantial sum of money, in excess of 85,000 USD, has been set aside to be transferred to you following unresolved compensation matters from previous years.

The funds are intended to be released to a trusted recipient rather than retained or forfeited, and your details are required to facilitate the transfer process.

You have been selected to assist with the release of these funds and to receive the associated benefit.
