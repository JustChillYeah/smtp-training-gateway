Subject: Negative feedback notification

Dear Member,

You have received negative feedback in relation to a recent transaction on the platform.

The transaction has been flagged as unauthorised due to the involvement of an account that is no longer registered. As a result, this matter falls under marketplace policy review.

eBay provides several formal procedures for managing feedback, including responding to comments, submitting follow-up statements, requesting mutual feedback withdrawal, or seeking mediation through an approved dispute resolution service.

To manage this issue and review the available options, you are advised to sign in to your account using the official feedback management process.
